# E-Yantra-Robotics-Competition- An annual national level Robotics Competiton, organized by IIT Bombay and funded by MHRD  
#  Supply Bot
An abstract prototype developed on the theme of Supply Bot, which involved determining the trajectory of a bot through Image Processing (using OpenCV) on the live feed of the arena by an overhead camera. The bot reached specific nodes (depicting cities) in need of aid (relief markers) and struck the relief markers to the center of the arena (representing the most affected village of the district), with a self-designed striking mechanism. Atmega 328p Microcontroller was programmed with Embedded C and involved white line sensor interfacing (to facilitate path following of the bot) making use of ADC channels, Servo and DC Motor Control with PWM and serial communication using USART protocol.
